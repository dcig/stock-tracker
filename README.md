Finance Tracker Application created and modified through "The Complete Ruby on Rails Developer Course"

Followed the basic build and modified the app to my own liking. Ideally, the end goal for this app is to help figure out a way to incrementally trade and sell stocks so that the user is constantly growing their portfolio. 

In addition, it would show the difference stock options owned, % of portfolio, % of diversification, money gained/lossed per stock & overall.
